## 📖 Project Purpose

Court systems worldwide face overwhelming backlogs, delaying justice and eroding public trust. Existing case scheduling often follows basic chronological rules, overlooking case urgency and social impact.

This project aims to:
- 📊 **Predict case priorities using Machine Learning**  
- 📱 **Provide legal professionals with estimated case scheduling insights**  
- 📣 **Offer public transparency into non-confidential court schedules**  
- 🏛️ **Assist court administrators in smarter, data-driven docket management**

Our ultimate mission is to **reduce backlogs, improve efficiency, and increase transparency** in judicial processes.

## 📊 Usage Guidelines

### 👩‍⚖️ For Legal Professionals / Lawyers
1. Register and log in.
2. Submit case details (case type, date filed, involved parties, urgency notes).
3. Receive a predicted **case priority score** or **estimated timeline**.
4. Monitor public case schedules through the app.

### 🏛️ For Court Administrators
1. Access ML-generated **priority-ranked case lists**.
2. Use dashboard insights for informed scheduling decisions.
3. Export prioritized schedules as needed.

### 👥 For General Public
- Open the app anonymously.
- View a public list of **ongoing and scheduled cases** (non-confidential data only).
- Check courtroom numbers, hearing dates, and case status.

### 👨‍💻 For ML/Data Engineers
- Access the `/ml-model` directory.
- Update training datasets.
- Retrain and evaluate ML models.
- Monitor model performance logs.
