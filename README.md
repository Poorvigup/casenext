## 📌 Problem Statement

Court systems worldwide are burdened by significant **backlogs**, delaying justice delivery. Current case prioritization relies on **manual processes** or **simple chronological orders**, which fail to reflect the true urgency or impact of a case.

This results in:
- ⏳ **Prolonged wait times** for litigants  
- 💸 **Increased legal costs**  
- ⚖️ **Diminished public trust**  
- 🚫 **Lack of accessible, real-time case progression information**  

Legal professionals also lack **predictive tools** to estimate the timelines for their cases within **opaque court systems**.

## 💡 Idea Overview

### 🎯 What We're Building:
A **mobile application** powered by **Machine Learning (ML)** to:
- 📊 **Analyze and predict case priorities**  
- 📅 **Provide real-time court schedules**  
- 🔒 **Preserve privacy while improving transparency**

### 📝 Core Features:
- 📈 ML-based case prioritization
- 📥 Lawyer & firm case management
- 📅 Public court schedules
- 📊 Administrative dashboard *(optional)*
